If you're already getting plenty of iron in your diet, however, taking iron supplements likely won't affect perceived effort while lifting weights." Padding="15,0,0,0"/>

This population group may find it easier to complete weightlifting sets after taking iron supplements to correct iron-deficiency anemia and the fatigue associated with it. A study published in 2009 in the 'American Journal of Clinical Nutrition' found that regular exercise tends to decrease iron stores in the body -- therefore, iron supplementation may help improve physical performance during periods of intense training."

Such side effects may include nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dark stools and heartburn. High iron stores may also be associated with heart disease, some cancers and Alzheimer's disease, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Ingesting too much iron over time can lead to diabetes, liver damage, vomiting, bloody diarrhea and even death. Always chat with your doctor before taking iron supplements."/>
