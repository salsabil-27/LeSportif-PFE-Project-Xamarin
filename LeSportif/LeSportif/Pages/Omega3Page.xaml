And seeing as how working out is itself an inflammatory activity, adding omega-3s might be just the thing you need to ward off muscle soreness, or what those in the training world call delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS can occur one to several days after strenuous exercise and significantly impact your ability to keep training at a high level."  />

According to a study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, omega-3s can help you burn fat by using it as energy. The same rule applies like it did for protein synthesis that the more omega-3s you have the better your body function as it burns more fat for energy as you exercise. In this study, 44 men and women received either 4 grams per day of safflower oil or 4 grams per day of fish oil (1600 mg EPA and 800 mg DHA). All tests were repeated following 6 weeks of treatment. Researchers found that those who supplemented with fish oil significantly increased lean mass and decreased fat mass."  />
